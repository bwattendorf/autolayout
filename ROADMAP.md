# Roadmap

**Stage:** M0 — file layer. Nothing places or routes yet.
**Updated:** 2026-10-12

## Headline numbers

| metric                                  | value      | measured / estimated   |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| corpus boards round-tripping byte-exact | not yet run | —                     |
| boards placed                           | 0          | —                      |
| boards routed                           | 0          | —                      |

## Milestones

| id | milestone | exit condition |
|----|-----------|----------------|
| M0 | Lossless file layer | every corpus `.kicad_pcb` parses and writes back byte-identical; malformed input returns an error, never a panic |
| M1 | Board model | footprints, pads (position, layer, net, pintype), nets, outline, keepouts readable; footprint move/rotate/flip written back and accepted by `kicad-cli pcb drc` with no new parse errors |
| M2 | Grader | `autolayout grade` reports, from the file alone: courtyard overlaps, parts off-board, ratsnest length, per-net HPWL, bypass-cap distance to the pin it serves, switch-loop size; cross-checked against KiCad DRC on the same file |
| M3 | Grouping | every footprint in exactly one group (fixed / converter / bypass / crystal+USB / per-connector field cluster / MCU support / residue), derived from connectivity and pintype only |
| M4 | Legal placer | rule-based initial placement + legalisation: no courtyard overlap, all on board, fixed parts untouched; beats the staging-grid input on every M2 metric |
| M5 | Optimising placer | wirelength/congestion optimisation (analytical or annealing, seeded); compared against the commercial return on the corpus |
| M6 | Routability | export DSN, route with Freerouting as an external process, report unconnected; placement scored by how well a router finishes it |
| M7 | Own router | (scoped once M5 results are in) |
